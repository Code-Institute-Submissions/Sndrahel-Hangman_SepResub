## SPORT TEAMS HANGMAN

Python - Milstone project 3 for Code Institute

## Project Summary

Sport Teams Hangman is a word guessing game.
ItÂ´s up to the player to identify a hidden word. In each round, the player guesses a character (number or letter): if it's present in the word, all instances are revealed; otherwise one of the hangman's body parts is drawn in on a gibbet. The game ends in a win if the team is entirely revealed by correct guesses, and ends in loss if the hangman's body is completely revealed instead. To assist the player, a visible record of all guessed letters is typically maintained.
